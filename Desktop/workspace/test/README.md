Task 1:
Build a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete resources. The
API should have the following features:
● Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
● Input validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and prevent attacks.
● Integration with a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL using an ORM like
Sequelize or Mongoose.
● Pagination and sorting of resources to enable efficient querying and browsing.
● Caching of frequently accessed resources to improve performance and reduce
load on the database.
Using TypeScript to build the API will yield extra credits.
